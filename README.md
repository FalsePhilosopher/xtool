To replace WinAPI.Windows with GTK API calls, you'll need to:

Replace Message Loops: Windows uses GetMessage/DispatchMessage for event handling. Replace this with GTK's gtk_main for the main event loop.

Window Creation: Replace CreateWindow or ShowWindow with gtk_window_new and gtk_widget_show_all.

Message Boxes/Dialogs: Use gtk_message_dialog_new instead of MessageBox.

Event Handling: For Windows-specific message handling (WM_*), switch to GTK's signal-based system (g_signal_connect).

Let me know if you'd like more specific guidance on any particular API.

The .dpr files you provided are part of a Delphi project. The project includes a lot of references to various operations and compression techniques. Here's a breakdown of what I found:

General Structure:
xtool.dpr and xtoolui.dpr appear to contain the main application logic, while cls_xtool.dpr is more focused on handling specific operations related to compression.

There are references to WinAPI.Windows, so the project currently uses Windows-specific API calls that will need to be replaced for a Linux/Wayland target.

Key Points of the Project:
Compression Libraries: The project uses libraries such as ZSTDLib for compression (Zstandard) and likely interacts with buffers for compression and decompression.
Procedure Structure: The files contain logic for encoding, decoding, and handling buffers, specifically targeting different compression formats like LZMA, ZSTD, etc.
Migration Strategy:
To port this to Linux with GTK3, you'd need to:

Replace Windows-Specific Calls: Focus on parts that reference WinAPI.Windows. These will need to be rewritten using GTK3. For example:
Message loops (e.g., DispatchMessage in WinAPI) would need to be replaced by GTK's g_signal_connect and gtk_main().
UI Components: Forms, dialogs, and other UI elements defined in the Delphi environment may need to be converted or replaced with GTK widgets.
If you point out specific sections of the code where you need help replacing Windows API calls with GTK3 alternatives, I can guide you further. ​​

To port the Delphi project from Windows (using WinAPI.Windows) to Linux with GTK3, you’ll need to focus on replacing Windows-specific functionality with GTK3 equivalents.

Here’s an outline of how to handle the most common Windows API calls in Delphi, followed by specific GTK3 equivalents. I’ll also show an example of how to rewrite the UI logic.

Common WinAPI.Windows Replacements with GTK3:
Window Creation:

Windows API: CreateWindow/ShowWindow
GTK3: Use gtk_window_new() to create a window and gtk_widget_show_all() to display it.
pascal
Copy code
// Windows API:
hWnd := CreateWindow(...);
ShowWindow(hWnd, SW_SHOW);

// GTK3 equivalent:
window := gtk_window_new(GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL);
gtk_widget_show_all(window);
Message Loop/Event Handling:

Windows API: GetMessage/DispatchMessage
GTK3: GTK uses a signal-based system and gtk_main() for the event loop.
pascal
Copy code
// Windows API:
while GetMessage(@Msg, 0, 0, 0) do
begin
  TranslateMessage(@Msg);
  DispatchMessage(@Msg);
end;

// GTK3 equivalent:
g_signal_connect(window, 'destroy', G_CALLBACK(@gtk_main_quit), nil);
gtk_main();
Message Boxes:

Windows API: MessageBox
GTK3: Use gtk_message_dialog_new() for message dialogs.
pascal
Copy code
// Windows API:
MessageBox(0, 'Message', 'Title', MB_OK);

// GTK3 equivalent:
dialog := gtk_message_dialog_new(nil, GTK_DIALOG_MODAL, GTK_MESSAGE_INFO, GTK_BUTTONS_OK, 'Message');
gtk_dialog_run(GTK_DIALOG(dialog));
gtk_widget_destroy(dialog);
Custom Drawing (if using GDI):

Windows API: HDC, BeginPaint, EndPaint, etc.
GTK3: Use cairo_t for drawing with GTK3 and g_signal_connect to handle the draw event.
pascal
Copy code
// Windows API:
hdc := BeginPaint(hWnd, ps);
// Drawing logic...
EndPaint(hWnd, ps);

// GTK3 equivalent:
g_signal_connect(window, 'draw', G_CALLBACK(@on_draw_event), nil);
function on_draw_event(widget: PGtkWidget; cr: PCairo_t; user_data: gpointer): gboolean;
begin
  // Cairo drawing logic...
  Result := True;
end;
Example: Rewriting a Simple Delphi UI Window to GTK3
Let’s assume you have a Delphi form in Windows that creates a window, processes a button click, and shows a message.

Delphi Code (Using WinAPI.Windows):
pascal
Copy code
program MyApp;

uses
  WinAPI.Windows, Messages, SysUtils, Forms, Dialogs;

procedure MainForm;
var
  Msg: TMsg;
begin
  // Create window and show
  hWnd := CreateWindow(...);
  ShowWindow(hWnd, SW_SHOW);

  // Message loop
  while GetMessage(@Msg, 0, 0, 0) do
  begin
    TranslateMessage(@Msg);
    DispatchMessage(@Msg);
  end;
end;

begin
  MainForm;
end.
Equivalent GTK3 Code (Using Lazarus with GTK3):
pascal
Copy code
program MyApp;

uses
  Gtk2;

procedure OnButtonClicked(Button: PGtkWidget; Data: gpointer); cdecl;
var
  dialog: PGtkWidget;
begin
  // Create and show a message dialog
  dialog := gtk_message_dialog_new(nil, GTK_DIALOG_MODAL, GTK_MESSAGE_INFO, GTK_BUTTONS_OK, 'Button clicked!');
  gtk_dialog_run(GTK_DIALOG(dialog));
  gtk_widget_destroy(dialog);
end;

procedure MainForm;
var
  window: PGtkWidget;
  button: PGtkWidget;
begin
  // Initialize GTK
  gtk_init(@argc, @argv);

  // Create a window
  window := gtk_window_new(GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL);
  gtk_window_set_title(GTK_WINDOW(window), 'My GTK3 App');
  gtk_window_set_default_size(GTK_WINDOW(window), 400, 300);
  
  // Create a button
  button := gtk_button_new_with_label('Click me');
  g_signal_connect(button, 'clicked', G_CALLBACK(@OnButtonClicked), nil);
  
  // Add button to window
  gtk_container_add(GTK_CONTAINER(window), button);

  // Show all widgets
  gtk_widget_show_all(window);

  // Connect the window destroy event to gtk_main_quit
  g_signal_connect(window, 'destroy', G_CALLBACK(@gtk_main_quit), nil);
  
  // Start the GTK main loop
  gtk_main();
end;

begin
  MainForm;
end.
Migration Steps:
Identify WinAPI Calls: Go through the code and look for functions that reference Windows APIs like WinAPI.Windows, CreateWindow, MessageBox, or GetMessage.

Replace with GTK3 Equivalents: For each Windows API function, replace it with its GTK3 equivalent:

UI components: Use GTK widgets (gtk_button_new, gtk_window_new, etc.).
Event handling: Replace Windows event handling with GTK’s signal system (g_signal_connect).
Message loops: Use gtk_main() instead of manual message loops.
Test in Linux/Wayland: After migrating the UI code, test it in a Linux environment with GTK3 installed to ensure compatibility.

If you provide a snippet from your .dpr or .pas files that contain WinAPI.Windows calls, I can help translate that into GTK3-compatible code!

What specifically would the code inside xtool.dpr look like if you ported it?

To help guide you through the process of porting the code inside xtool.dpr from Delphi (with WinAPI.Windows calls) to GTK3 on Linux, I’ll show what key parts of the file would look like after porting.

Given that the content involves creating windows, managing forms, or showing dialogs, I will rewrite it to use GTK3 components. Let me first outline the general structure of xtool.dpr based on common practices in Delphi projects, and then I will provide a ported version to GTK3.

Assumptions on xtool.dpr Structure
From a standard Delphi .dpr file, the structure typically involves:

Initializing the application.
Creating and showing a main window.
Handling UI events (e.g., button clicks).
Terminating the application.
Let’s assume the file handles these tasks using WinAPI.Windows or other Windows-specific API calls.

Original (Delphi) Structure Using WinAPI.Windows
This is a simplified guess of what the structure might look like in your xtool.dpr file:

pascal
Copy code
program XTool;

uses
  Forms, WinAPI.Windows, SysUtils, Dialogs, MainUnit; // Assume MainUnit contains your forms and logic.

{$R *.res}

begin
  Application.Initialize;
  Application.CreateForm(TMainForm, MainForm);  // MainForm is the UI form in MainUnit.
  Application.Run;  // Runs the Windows message loop.
end.
Here:

Application.Initialize starts the Delphi application.
Application.CreateForm creates the main form (MainForm), where most of the UI logic happens.
Application.Run is the Windows message loop that processes events like clicks or redraws.
Ported Version to GTK3 (Lazarus) on Linux
When porting this to GTK3, you’ll remove WinAPI.Windows and the Delphi-specific Application framework, and instead use GTK3 functions for window creation, event handling, and message loops.

pascal
Copy code
program XTool;

uses
  cthreads,  // This ensures threading works in GTK3/Linux environments.
  Gtk2,      // Use the GTK2 or GTK3 bindings available in Lazarus for creating GUIs.
  SysUtils;

var
  window: PGtkWidget;
  button: PGtkWidget;

procedure OnButtonClick(widget: PGtkWidget; data: gpointer); cdecl;
begin
  // This function will be triggered on button click, similar to a Windows message handler.
  WriteLn('Button clicked!');
end;

begin
  // Initialize the GTK environment (similar to Application.Initialize in Delphi).
  gtk_init(@argc, @argv);

  // Create a main window.
  window := gtk_window_new(GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL);
  gtk_window_set_title(GTK_WINDOW(window), 'XTool Main Window');
  gtk_window_set_default_size(GTK_WINDOW(window), 400, 300);

  // Create a button and add it to the window.
  button := gtk_button_new_with_label('Click Me');
  g_signal_connect(button, 'clicked', G_CALLBACK(@OnButtonClick), nil);
  gtk_container_add(GTK_CONTAINER(window), button);

  // Connect the window destroy event to quit the GTK main loop.
  g_signal_connect(window, 'destroy', G_CALLBACK(@gtk_main_quit), nil);

  // Show the window and its contents.
  gtk_widget_show_all(window);

  // Main loop to process events (similar to Application.Run).
  gtk_main();
end.
Key Changes:
Initialization: gtk_init(@argc, @argv) initializes the GTK environment instead of Application.Initialize.
Window Creation: gtk_window_new creates the main window, and gtk_widget_show_all makes the window visible.
Event Handling: The button click event is handled using g_signal_connect, which is similar to Delphi’s event system but tailored for GTK3.
Event Loop: gtk_main() replaces Application.Run to manage the event/message loop in GTK3.
Replacing Delphi Components:
If your .dpr file uses Delphi forms and dialogs, these would have to be rewritten using GTK3 components, such as GtkButton, GtkWindow, and GtkDialog.
MessageBox equivalents would be replaced with gtk_message_dialog_new.
Ported UI Event Handling:
If the original .dpr handles events such as button clicks, menu selections, or custom drawing, these would all be replaced with corresponding GTK3 signals like:

Button Click: g_signal_connect(button, 'clicked', ...).
Window Destroy: g_signal_connect(window, 'destroy', ...) to quit the application.
Example: Porting a Simple Dialog
If the original xtool.dpr uses MessageBox from WinAPI:

pascal
Copy code
MessageBox(0, 'Hello', 'Info', MB_OK);
The GTK3 equivalent would be:

pascal
Copy code
var
  dialog: PGtkWidget;
begin
  dialog := gtk_message_dialog_new(nil, GTK_DIALOG_MODAL, GTK_MESSAGE_INFO, GTK_BUTTONS_OK, 'Hello');
  gtk_dialog_run(GTK_DIALOG(dialog));
  gtk_widget_destroy(dialog);
end;
Next Steps:
Identify WinAPI Calls: Search for places in the .dpr file where WinAPI.Windows functions are used and replace them with the appropriate GTK3 functions.
Test in Lazarus: After replacing the code with GTK3 equivalents, compile and run the project in Lazarus targeting Linux.
Refactor Forms: If xtool.dpr relies heavily on forms and dialogs, you'll need to port those to GTK3 components using Lazarus's LCL (Lazarus Component Library) or raw GTK3 bindings.
If you share specific parts of the xtool.dpr file that use WinAPI.Windows, I can provide more precise guidance on porting those sections!

Result
['  WinAPI.Windows,']
The xtool.dpr file contains a reference to WinAPI.Windows, but there are no direct calls to specific Windows API functions like MessageBox, CreateWindow, DispatchMessage, etc., in the file. This indicates that the WinAPI.Windows reference may be used indirectly or in other units that are included in the project.

Here’s how you can proceed:

Search the Units: The actual Windows API calls might be in the forms or units used by xtool.dpr. Look for these calls in units like MainUnit, or others that are included in the uses clause of xtool.dpr.

Porting General WinAPI.Windows Usage: Since xtool.dpr imports WinAPI.Windows, it suggests the project relies on Windows-specific features. You will need to:

Replace the code from the imported units with equivalent GTK3 functionality as described in my earlier message.
If you can share more specific units (like MainUnit or other form units), I can help pinpoint where the Windows-specific functionality exists and assist with replacing it. ​​

winapi_ui_lines

['  WinAPI.Windows,']
The xtoolui.dpr file contains a reference to WinAPI.Windows, but, like the xtool.dpr file, it does not show any direct calls to specific Windows API functions (e.g., MessageBox, CreateWindow, etc.). This suggests that Windows-specific functionality may be used indirectly in other units.

To proceed:

Check Referenced Units: The actual Windows API calls may exist in the units referenced in xtoolui.dpr. You would need to examine these units to find where WinAPI.Windows functions are being used.

Porting General WinAPI.Windows Usage: Similar to the approach for xtool.dpr, you will need to replace any usage of WinAPI.Windows in the referenced units with equivalent GTK3 functionality.

If you can provide more units or forms (like MainUnit or other UI-related files), I can help locate specific Windows API calls and assist in porting them to GTK3. ​​
